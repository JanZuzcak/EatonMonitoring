Solution contains three projects:
1. DataModels - is static library that contains data models sent from device to server including json serialization/deserialization routines
2. Device 
	- executable application that collects measured values from device and sends them to server via udp connection
	- brief description of main objects:
		- DeviceManeger is a root application object, it manages DataSender and MeasurementReader objects
		- MeasurementReader is an object responsible for reading measured values from device, recently DummyMeasurementReader with randomly generated values is used instead
		- DataSender sends measured values as json stream to server
3. Server
	- executable application that receives measured values from devices and makes some statistics from received data
	- brief description of main objects:
		- ServerManeger is a root application object, it manages DataReceiver and DataProcessor objects
		- DataProcessor is an object responsible for making some simple statistics from received device data
		- DataReceiver receives measured values from devices

3rd party libraries used in the solution:
